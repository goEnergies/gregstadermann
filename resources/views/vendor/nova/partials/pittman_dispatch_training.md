# **BLIS - Pittman - Get Manasssas Dispatching Initiative**

## Loading Numbers

Loading numbers entered by Manassas staff were incorrectly added. Bulk Supplier and Supplier fields often backwards. Need to remove bad loading numbers while keeping the good ones for Charlotte region.

    ### Possible fixes

-   Use audit trail table to find who entered
-   Find column on loading number table that is unique to manassas region: delete all loading numbers that have terminal_id mapped to Apex, Buckeye, Yorktown Plains, Sunoco, Xenith, Arch, or Center.
